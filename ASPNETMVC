Validation using a service layer instead of a controller: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/models-data/validating-with-a-service-layer-cs

- Should not place database logic inside controller actions
    - More difficult to maintain
- Should instead place all database logic in a seperate repository layer
- Controllers are responsible for application flow control logic and the repository is responsible for data access logic
- A service layer is an additional layer in an ASP.NET MVC application that mediates communication between a controller and repository layer
    - The service layer contains business logic. In particular, it contains validation logic.
