# Backend Roadmap Notes

## Internet

### How does the internet work?
- The internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols

- Information travels through various mediums

#### IP Addresses and DNS
- Protocals for information traversing from one computer to another
- https://youtu.be/5o8CwafCxnU
- IP = Internet Prototol
- IP Address = Internet Protocol Address

- First numbers represent the Country/Network of a device
- Second set of numbers represent the Region of a device
- 3rd set represent the Subnetwork
- 4th set is the specific address of the device
- This version is called IPv4

- IPv6 is the newer method
- DNS (Domain Name Services) connects an IP to a URL
- DNS servers are split into a distributed Hierarchy to handle all the requests from all devices
- Each one is responsible for a different set of domains (Eg. .com, .net, .org)
- DNS Spoofing is when a hacker goes into a server and changes it to match a domain name with the wrong IP address

  #### Packets, Routing, and Reliability
  - Information transfer on the internet from one computer to another does not need to follow a fixed path
  - This information transfer is done in the form of packets and they may follow different routes depending on certain factors
